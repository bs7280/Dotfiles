Dotfiles

this repository holds all of my dot files and bash scripts and is intended
to make it easier to not only backup and use version control on my important
scripts and config files, but also make it easier to work with my desired
settings on other people's computers.

There will be a shell script that will take all of my config files and
replace the config files on the computer the script is being run on
with the config files in this repostiory. All of the alerady existing
config files will be put in a folder so they are not replaced.

There will be multiple options that will allow the user to specify which
files will be transfered and how they are transfered.

for example I could just want my .vimrc file transfered.

There will be another shell script that is for tearing down my setup 
that essentially replaces all of the origional config files.
